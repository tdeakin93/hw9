This project allows the user to use the command line to generate a README.md file specific to their own project based on their inputs to a series of questions. In doing so, their given answers will be inserted into a README file that follows industry best practices, streamlining the process while also helping to facilitate high-quality work.

## Installation
  In order to run this code, the user must have node installed on their device. 
<!-- I'd like to run options of a 1 2 3 step process potentially  here -->

## Usage
  In order to use this application, the user must use node to run the index.js file. In doing so, the user will see a series of prompts in their terminal to which they can respond. In doing so, a template README file will be generated using input data.
<!-- I'd also like to potentially have this where it opens in the users local word processor....  -->

## Credits
  One of the biggest aids in completing this was the helpful people at askBCS in slack, as they were able to help me overcome some hurdles faced.
<!-- Would like to have the optional parts of this read me only display question if user "opts in" like do you want to include a contribution section? If yes, ask question, if no, don't -->
